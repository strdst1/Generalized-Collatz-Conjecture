# Generalized-Collatz-Conjecture
A Python Script to generate number sequences using the Collatz conjecture as its basis.
The Algorithm is as follows: 
Given a positive integer x, perform a * x + b where a, b are also positive odd integers, perform x/2 if x is even. Do this for every new a*x+b generated until a number gets repeated. 
The Program also plots these hailstone numbers on a graph using Matplotlib.
Different graphs for different branches seem to show that each sequence returns a finite cycle and a finite numbe of cycles.
